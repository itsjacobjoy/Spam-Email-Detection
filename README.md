# Spam-Email-Detection
I have implemented the concepts of Natural Language Processing in order to create a model to detect which emails are spam and which aren't. 
Concepts like Stemming have been used to clean up the words in the emails 
Bag of words is used to extract important words from an email

Both Naive Bayes Model and SVC have been used to check which can give a more accurate model for detecting spam.
